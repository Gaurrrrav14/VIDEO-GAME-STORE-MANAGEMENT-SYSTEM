# VIDEO-GAME-STORE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM'
INTRODUCTION:
This software project is developed to automate the functionalities of a Video Game Shop. The purpose of the software project is to develop the Inventory Management System to help with the easy management of stock for an admin as well as purchasing items for a customer.
This software being simple in design and working and being interactive with the user, does not require much of training to users. It will help the store owners to cope with the rising technology and help them manage their stock.
This software project is designed in C++. The project will have a database to store all the information about the various stock details. It can have either a GUI or a CUI. But in this project we have adopted the CUI approach.

OBJECTIVES:
The objective of the software project is to develop a computerized Inventory Management System to automate the functions of a video game store. With this project I hope to ease the problems faced by any shop owner who faces problems on a daily basis to conduct his business at his shop. That's why to simplify their task, to give them relief from manual work, and to minimize their burden, I took the challenge and started working with this project to automate their job using Python programming.
The proposed software system is expected to do the following functionality:
❖ For Admin:
• To easily access the stock and perform basic functions such as
o Add items
o Remove items
o Update items
o Display items.
• It provides an easy way to login or logout their accounts and also provides an option to create their account if they do not have one already.
• It helps them to be updated with their stock and also be able to change it according to their needs.
❖ For Customer:
• To Easily Login and Logout of their accounts and if they do not have an account they can create one.
• It helps them to see what’s in store for them and to filter the display results according to their needs.
• It also enables them to search any of the items they require.
• It provides them an option to add, remove, update and display items in their shopping cart and display the total amount to be paid whenever they ask.

LIMITATIONS:
Despite the best effort of the developers, the following limitations and functional boundaries are visible, which limits the scope of this application
• This project can only be functional if you have the specific files pe downloaded on your device.
• It is not a web based project.
• It may need more customization to fill the specific needs of every user.
• More functions and options can be added to increase and enhance the functionality.
• The project can have a Graphical user Interface for a better user interface
• There is no option to actually pay the bill it just shows the total amount to be paid.
